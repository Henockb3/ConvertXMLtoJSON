# ConvertXMLtoJSON
Java program to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML.
Place the desired XML or JSON file for conversion within the EnterpriseAddressBookXMLToJSON folder of the program and run App.java .
Once program is running select from the options to convert to your desired format and type in the filename you want to convert that is located in the EnterpriseAddressBookXMLToJSON folder.(Example ab.xml) or (JSON.json) .
Current conversion is available for XML to JSON and JSON TO XML.
As an example there is an ab.xml file to test out this program once that file is converted, a new JSON file will be created in the EnterpriseAddressBookXMLToJSON folder and you can test JSON to XML using the newly converted JSON file.

Thank You!
